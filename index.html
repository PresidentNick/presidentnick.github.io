            <h2>About Nick</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate of The University of Texas at Austin. I received my Bachelor of Science and Arts in Computer Science in December 2016. I was born in Miami and I lived there until I was about 10. Then I moved to Brownsville, TX and went to
                middle school and high school there. After graduated high school in 2012, I applied to the University of Texas at Austin. I've been living in Austin ever since. I love playing music and I was a member of the UT Pep Band as well as the
                UT Steel Pan Ensemble. I carried on my love for music and joined a local community band called blowcomotion. I love biking all over Austin on mountain bike trails and road biking on the quiter roads. I also enjoy solving problems, 
                so I figured I would make a career out of it.

            <b><u>Elligo Health Research</u></b>
            <p>At Elligo Health Research I work with a small talented team to solve engineering and business problems together and as an individual contributor. I've introduced some useful engineering practices that were adopted by the team. I help re-architect various existing services and plan for new ones. I review my teammate's code and they review mine.</p>
            <b><u>b.Well Connected Health</u></b>
            <p>The b.well connected health platform provides an all-in-one integrated solution for consumer engagement, holistic health management, and cost containment. Our use of longitudinal aggregated data creates a complete picture of health for each consumer and is aggregated to allow for true population health management.  Our unique approach to partner integration allows our customers to change their programs in real time as the health needs of their population change, not on an annual sales cycle.  With the b.well platform there is one contract, one implementation and the elimination of point-solution fatigue.  We provide real-time transparent dashboards to all customers highlighting return on investment, cost containment opportunities, engagement metrics and outreach campaign outcomes, clinical risk factors and disease states. b.well supports health plans, health systems, employers and pharmaceutical companies to bring their digital strategy to life and enables them to provide their employees, members and patients with the one thing they do not have today; one place to manage all aspects of their health.</p>

            <p>ITT (Interline Travel and Tour) is an e-commerce travel company with international presence which sells cruises, resorts, tours, and air. As a senior python web developer I was responsible for helping implement five of ITT's websites. I also
                helped maintain two projects that I designed, implemented, and delivered while I worked for ITT as a contractor via SoalTech LLC</p>
            <b><u>SoalTech LLC</u></b>

            <h5><b>BTCPayServer Payment Processor</b></h5>
            <p>I'm in the process of building and deploying a payment server for the bakery that would allow it to accept bitcoin transactions via the lightning network using several open-source projects including bitcoin core, lnd, and btcpayserver.
            <h4><b><u>Elligo Health Research</u></b></h4>
            <p>I started working at Elligo Health Research in September 2021. I joined their patient engagement team as and have begun to contribute new features and bug fixes into production.</p>
            <h5><b>Root Platform</b></h5>
            <p>I've helped design and implement new API endpoints. I helped set up the testing environment for the platform so there are tests run in CI/CD. I've been learning React to help implement features on the front-end.</p>
            <h4><b><u>b.Well Connected Health</u></b></h4>
            <p>I began working at b.Well Connected Health during the coronavirus pandemic of 2020.</p>
            <h5><b>Content Management System Expertise</b></h5>
            <p>I am providing Content Management System expertise to the engineering and product teams. I am helping them transistion out of a tedious process to deploy content that has at least one month of lead time and involves several engineers to deploy content. I am helping change the system to reduce lead time and the amount of people involved to deploy new content to our platform. My experience developing 5 e-commerce websites for ITT with Wagtail from 2015-2020 has helped me provide this expertise.</p>
            <h5><b>Serializer Optimization</b></h5>
            <p>I am helping optimize the serializers for the connected platform api.
            <h4><b><u>Interline Travel and Tour (ITT)</u></b></h4>
            <p>I first started working with ITT as a contractor while I was still in school at UT. After contracting with them for a year and a half and earning my degree at UT, I was hired to work directly with ITT. I combined projects spanning both time
                periods in this section because ITT was the sole client I worked with during my time as a contractor for SoalTech LLC</p>
            <h5><b>Dargal.com site development</b></h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Dargal.com was in active development until the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. Below are screenshots of the pre-production website. I implemented user authentication, cruise and resort search, cruise and resort details and contact/booking pages.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.touchdownfrance.com/">touchdownfrance.com</a> is ITT's French website. I developed several of the content blocks for this website and many of its key features. This site also follows the shared web apps paradigm

                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.touchdown.co.uk/">Touchdown.co.uk</a> is ITT's United Kingdom website. I developed several of the content blocks for this website and many of its key features. Touchdown.co.uk was built by using the same shared
                    django web apps that support the perx.com site. Each product line (cruise, resort, tour, air) was separated into its own djagno app and each website is its own django app. That way when changes in business logic happen to a product,
                    it can be reflected against all four of ITT's websites.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.perx.com/">Perx.com</a> is ITT's United States website. It was refactored as a django app when I got hired with ITT as a contractor via SoalTech LCC. I helped develop several of the models and templates for the
                    site as well as the business logic of various processes. As an individual contributor I helped develop various consumer facing features of perx.com such as site breadcrumbs, authentication system, and targeted advertisements to name
                    a few. This site also has several internal features used by content editors that I had architected and developed using the Wagtail CMS. I continued to maintain it after I got hired directly with ITT.

            <b>Cruise Pricing Importer</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Perx receives pricing feeds from various cruise lines to keep their shopping system rates as fresh as possible. These pricing feeds don't follow a standard format and even change the format sometimes or even provide empty pricing feeds. I designed, implemented,
                    and delivered a django web app that can handle different vendor feeds and process them according to their format. The site supports automated feed importing and manual feed importing. I built in a dashboard so that the people that
                    import cruise rates can easily see if there are any errors with the imports. This web app normalizes the relevant data into the internal company database and ignores the rest of the irrelevant data. The site also deletes rates in the
                    database and files on the server that are older than 5 days. Lastly, old rates can be manually flushed out if needed. This is a core business app that gets used every day at ITT.

            <b>Roadshow Kiosk</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The marketing department at Perx goes to tradeshows/roadshows at airports to get people to sign up for the website. Traditionally, they ask people to fill out a paper form with their information and then they enter the customer info in the customer database
                    manually when they return to the office. In order to modernize this process, I wrote a flask application that can work completely offline (these tradeshows hardly have internet or power access) to capture and store user registration
                    data. This application was deployed on chromebooks that were put in developer mode to cut hardware costs. Once the marketing came back from the tradeshow, the files storing the user data are imported and used to register users into
                    ITT's system automatically.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Image Scraper</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In order to prepare for the launch of the new perx.com site, developers needed to know what image assets they had to use in the site. I wrote a python script that recursively searches a directory and all its sub-directories for images. The script outputs
                    image metadata like path, dimension, and resolution to a csv file so that the developers could get a comprehensive snapshot of all the images they have instead of manually searching for them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>User Tracking</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In order to get a more detailed view of how customers use the new perx.com site, I wrote a django middleware that can track user and session metadata. Later this information can be used for data visualization.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4><b><u>The University of Texas at Austin Department of Anthropology</u></b></h4>
            <p>As I worked on completing the classes I needed for my Computer Science degree at UT, I started working with professor Denné Reed in the Department of Anthropology. He needed some assistance developing a couple of new features and updating
                some old code on two websites he ran for a paleoanthropology website. Those two websites are <a href="https://paleocore.org/">paleocore.org</a> and <a href="http://paleoanthro.org/home/">paleoanthro.org</a>. Professor Denné Reed was the
                person who initally taught me about Django so I could learn the core functions of the Django framework needed for the website.</p>
            <b>Automated Repository Installation</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    As the paleocore.org website started getting more features and needing more dependencies, it became more tedious to install all the requirements and make sure all the database connections are working whenever someone wanted to contribute to the site.
                    I wrote a Python script that automated that installation process. That way, deploying a new local instance of the repository became very easy.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Django Template Implementation</b>

                    Every time a new dissertation was added to the paleoanthro.org database, someone would go in and manually edit the dissertation HTML to reflect the new entry. I wrote a template using the django templating language so that the HTML would be automatically
                    generated on the fly to reflect all the dissertations in the database.

            <h4><b><u>Caesars Entertainment Corporation</u></b></h4>
            <p>In the summer of 2014 I got an internship for Caesars in Las Vegas. This was the first time Caesars was running an internship program. Me along with 3 other computer science students at UT were selected to live on the strip in Las Vegas at
                The Quad hotel for three months while helping develop the IT internship program at Caesars.</p>
            <b>Social Media Mention Tracking</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I wrote Python scripts with facebook and twitter libraries to track users whenever a Caesars brand was mentioned. This information was plotted on a map.

            <h4><b><u>Google</u></b></h4>
            <p>Google has a three week summer camp that is targeted towards graduating high school seniors of minority backgrounds that have no computer science experience with an interest in learning it. I applied and was selected for Google's Computer
                Science Summer Institute (CSSI). In the summer of 2012 I was housed at Santa Clara University along with 29 other high school seniors that had just graduated. Google would take us in a shuttle everyday to their headquarters in Mountain
                View. At their headquarters we were taught all day by Google engineers about the core fundamentals of computer science for two weeks. On the last week, we were split into 10 groups of 3 and each group developed a website with the guidance
                and mentorship of the Google engineers who taught us the previous two weeks. On the last day of the summer camp, the teams presented their websites to a live audience of googlers along with a stream for any googlers who weren't present
                at the demo. On the weekends, Google had various fun activities for us along with free time for ourselves.</p>
            <b>Extreme Games</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    By working with a team of me and two other people, we wrote a website that had two games. One was rock, paper, scissors with 15 different options. The other game was mad libs. The site had leadboards to track user scores.
